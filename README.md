# SolarDB

## Background

* Households with solar panels can use their power to charge EVs. 
* The goal is to charge the car powered by the sun. Green energy!
* Also: To charge with less costs it is necessary to use the solar production (Germany: 12 Cent by Solar vs. 29 Cents)
* 

## Idea
* Automatic charging the EV with the solar panels when reaching a defined kW/h peak.
* That allows the owner to charge by green energy only!
