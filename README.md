# SolarDB

## That's us
* Manuel & Christian
* We build Apple Software (iOS & macOS) for more than 10 years now
* We both drive EVs
* Manuel & Christian have a solar panel installation on their roof in 2018
* We have the same inverter model which has a simple iOS app. This app just shows the electric production

## Motivation
* Use and produce green energy
* Charge your car with low costs!
* To be independent from big energy corporations (i.e. RWE) 
* Less coal! More Solar powered energy. 
* Reduce the carbon footprint!

## Background

* The inverter iOS app cannot be used for a smart home or EV. It's just a monitor.
* It would sense to use the data in order to control your home or EV automatically
* Households with solar panels can use their power to charge EVs. 
* The goal is to charge the car powered by the sun. Green energy!
* Also: To charge with less costs it is necessary to use the solar production (Germany: 12 Cent by Solar vs. 29 Cents)


## Idea
* Use the data coming from the solar inverter to control the charge your EV
* Automatic charging the EV with the solar panels when reaching a defined kW/h peak.
* That allows the owner to charge by green energy only!
* Show the current solar production in the car.
